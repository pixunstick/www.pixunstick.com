# About

This is a program designed to flash a color for a specific pixel. You can use this to attempt to unstick a pixel by flashing the stuck pixel for several hours (results not guaranteed).

# History

This program was inspired by [UDPixel](http://udpix.free.fr/). I started working on it because my otherwise lovely Acer 720P Touch Chromebook got a little slightly-stuck pixel a few hours after I started using it.
